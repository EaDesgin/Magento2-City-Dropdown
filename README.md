# Magento 2 City Dropdown

- City Dropdown for Magento 2 was created to allow users / merchants to include cities and region / state / province as a dropdown in the checkout process, but more recently when you save a new address, this option is also found there.
- With this you can import the cities of each region and you can use them as a dropdown in different processes (checkout, new address etc).


# Requirements:

# Configuration:

- To install the extension, use the composer, then go to Admin → Store → Configuration → Eadesign Settings → RomCity to activate it.
